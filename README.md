Hello folks!

This repository is to help you optimize your Ansible - Windows Integrations.
The main idea of this automation Playbooks is to leave log files and do more actions
needed that current Windows Module can not. 

You can fork or clone the project and do the adjustment you need for your use cases.
Take care more of the logics behind this Playbooks are given in PowerShell, so if you know
how to programm or give instructions within PowerShell, that'd be all.
